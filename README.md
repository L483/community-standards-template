# community-standards-template

This repository is a project template for standardizing labels, templates, and the like across projects.

This project still misses a mechanism to automatically apply its labels to another project without creating OAuth-Tokens that grant third-party-repositories [write access to GitHub data](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/authorizing-oauth-apps#oauth-app-access).

However, implementing a custom solution that generates and uses OAuth-Tokes that grant this project write access to GitHub data is acceptable.

At least using this project as a template enables a more effortless experience of setting up projects complying with GitHub's *community standards*.
