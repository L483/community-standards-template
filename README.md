# default-labels-and-issues

A repository to standardize my labels and issue templates accross projects.

Still looking for a good way to automatically apply the labels to another project without creating OAuth-Tokens that grant a third-party [write access to GitHub data](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/authorizing-oauth-apps#oauth-app-access).

However, by using this project as a template, it is at least effortlessly possible to reuse issue templates.
