How to use this template:
Do NOT abuse a "<PLACEHOLDER>" to report "security vulnerabilities".
In such instances, act as described in the project's "security policy" or if the project does not specify how to report these incidents, open a "security advisory".

Do NOT ABUSE a "<PLACEHOLDER>" issue to test out new stuff that may or may not be included in the project, like, experimenting with new tools to see whether you can get them to work or whether they are appropriate for the project.
Use a "feature request" or a "feature change request" instead, work on them on their own branch, and (if fitting) mark them with the `Flag: Suggestion` label.
Keep in mind not all "opened" and "accepted" issues have to be resolved. They can also be "abandoned" if the experiments turn out as failure.

Do NOT abuse a "<PLACEHOLDER>" issue to refactor the code itself, like renaming a variable or class.
Do NOT abuse a "<PLACEHOLDER>" issue to fix a bug caused by, for example, a typo, and use a "bug report" instead.
Use it ONLY for <PLACEHOLDER>.

If there are "multiple little improvement suggestions", you can mention them bundled within a "single issue" because the effort of writing issues should not drastically surpass the effort of resolving them.
Make sure to present each improvement DISTINCTLY from the rest and to use the SAME ORDER of refinements in each section when bundling multiple improvements inside one issue.
However, create a SEPARATE issue for each issue that is concerned with the "<PLACEHOLDER>" itself.

Keep ALL of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
ONLY add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
