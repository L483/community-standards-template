Label usage:
- select any number of fitting labels with a "Flag: " prefix
- select any number of fitting labels with a "For: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Priority: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Scope: " prefix
- do not add, change or remove any label with a "Status: " or "Type: " prefix

Look at the label descriptions to get a better understanding of them and pick the most fitting.
If more than one "Type: " label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
The issue should then be split into multiple issues in a way that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
