        If there are *multiple little improvement suggestions*, you can mention them bundled within a *single issue* because the effort of writing issues should not drastically surpass the effort of resolving them.<br/>
        Make sure to present each improvement **distinctly** from the rest and to use the **same order** of refinements in each section when bundling multiple improvements inside one issue.<br/>
        However, create a **separate issue** for each issue that is concerned with the *documentation suite* itself.
        
        All text areas support markdown syntax unless explicitly noted otherwise.

        **Information for contributors about label usage:**<br/>
        
        - select *any number* of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
        - select *any number* of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
        - select **exactly one** label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
        - select **exactly one** label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
        - **never** tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
        - **never** add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
        Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
        If more than one `Type: ` label fits this issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
        You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls **exactly into one** category.
