        If you are here because you followed the instructions for a **drastic** *feature change*, here is what you must do inside this *feature request*:<br/>
        1. Choose a new, fitting title for the new feature.
        2. Then, look for the **original issue** that introduced the feature you want to replace.
        3. Link the *original issue* inside the *"Related Issues"* section.<br/>
        4. Afterwards, open a *feature drop request* for the feature you want to replace.
           1. There, state and explain your replacement plans instead of only writing about a *pure* drop.
           2. Link the *original issue* as well as this *feature request* in your new *feature drop request* inside the *"Related Issues"* section.
        
        All text areas support markdown syntax unless explicitly noted otherwise.

        **Information for contributors about label usage:**<br/>
        
        - select *any number* of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
        - select *any number* of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
        - select **exactly one** label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
        - select **exactly one** label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
        - **never** tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
        - **never** add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
        Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
        If more than one `Type: ` label fits this issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
        You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls **exactly into one** category.
