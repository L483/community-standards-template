How to use this template:
If you are here because you followed the instructions for a DRASTIC "feature change", here is what you must do inside this "feature request":
  1. Choose a new, fitting title for the new feature.
  2. Then, look for the ORIGINAL ISSUE that introduced the feature you want to replace.
  3. Link the "original issue" inside the "Related Issues" section.
  4. Afterwards, open a "feature drop request" for the feature you want to replace.
    1. There, state and explain your replacement plans instead of only writing about a "pure" drop.
    2. Link the "original issue" as well as this "feature request" in your new "feature drop request" inside the "Related Issues" section.

Keep ALL of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
ONLY add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
