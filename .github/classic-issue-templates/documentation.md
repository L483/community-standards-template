<!--
How to use this template:
If there are "multiple little improvement suggestions", you can mention them bundled within a "single issue" because the effort of writing issues should not drastically surpass the effort of resolving them.
Make sure to present each improvement DISTINCTLY from the rest and to use the SAME ORDER of refinements in each section when bundling multiple improvements inside one issue.
However, create a SEPARATE ISSUE for each issue that is concerned with the "documentation suite" itself.

Keep ALL of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
ONLY add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.
-->

## Object of Interest
<!--
Describe the documentation (suite) parts that require overwork as specifical as possible.
Where is the documentation, or where are code comments wrong/missing? Where could the documentation suite be improved?
-->
*None*

## Problem/Motivation
<!--
Describe your problem or motivation that caused your documentation request as detailed as possible.
Why does the documentation, or why do code comments seem wrong/incomplete? Why does the documentation suite need improvement?
-->
*None*

## Solution Proposal
<!--
If it is about the documentation suite, describe the solution that you have in mind as detailed as possible. Otherwise, write how you would update the documentation/code comments or at least name the essential points.
How would you formulate the documentation/code comments? How could the documentation suite be improved?
-->
*None*

## Impact
<!--
Describe potential side effects of your solution proposal, which could cause follow-up issues (usually only relevant when suggesting changes to the documentation suite), to the best of your knowledge.
-->
*None*

## Acceptance Criteria
<!--
Specify the acceptance criteria as a task list that contains one or more entries.
e.g.:
  - [ ] Do this

  ...
-->
*None*

## Further Information
<!--
Add additional helpful, issue-related information, such as, links, screenshots, sketches, considerations, thoughts, etc.
-->
*None*

## Related Issues
<!--
Add a bullet point list of other related issues, in case there are any. In particular, the issue(s) (if you can narrow it/them down) that introduced the need for a documentation request would be helpful.
e.g.:
  - #42
  - #73

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
  Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
  If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
  You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
