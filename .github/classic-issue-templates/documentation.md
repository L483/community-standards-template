<!--
How to use this template:
If there are multiple, little improvement suggestions, you can mention them bundled in the same issue, because the effort of writing issues should not drastically overweigh the effort of resolving them.
Make sure to present each improvement distinctly from the rest and use the same order of improvements in each section when bundling multiple improvements inside one issue.
However, create a separate issue for each issue that is concerned with the documentation suite itself.

The issue name has to be written in kebap-case.
Keep all of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
Only add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.
-->

## Object of Interest
<!-- describe the parts of the documentation (suite) that are in need of an improvement as specific as possible -->
*None*

## Problem/Motivation
<!-- describe your problem or motivation that caused your documentation request (is something inaccurate/missing, is it about the documentation suite) as detailed as possible -->
*None*

## Solution Proposal
<!-- if it is about the documentation suite, describe the solution you have in mind as detailed as possible, otherwise just write how you would update the documentation or at least name the main points -->
*None*

## Impact
<!-- describe potential side effects of your solution proposal that can cause follow-up issues (usually only relevant when suggesting changes to the documentation suite) to the best of your knowledge -->
*None*

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- specify the acceptance criteria as a task list with one or more entries: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists -->
*None*

## Further Information
<!-- add additional helpful, issue related information such as links, screenshots, sketches, your own considerations and thoughts, etc. -->
*None*

## Related Issues
<!-- add a bullet point list of other related issues in case there are any, the issue(s) (if it/they can be narrowed down) that introduced the need for a documentation request would be particularly useful -->
*None*

<!--
Label usage:
- select any number of fitting labels with a "Flag: " prefix
- select any number of fitting labels with a "For: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Priority: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Scope: " prefix
- do not add, change or remove any label with a "Status: " or "Type: " prefix

Look at the label descriptions to get a better understanding of them and pick the most fitting.
If more than one "Type: " label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
The issue should then be split into multiple issues in a way that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
