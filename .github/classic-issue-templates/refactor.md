<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
