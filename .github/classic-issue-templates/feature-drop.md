<!--
Look for the ORIGINAL ISSUE that introduced the feature you want to remove and use its feature name as the issue title.
        
If you are here because you followed the instructions for a DRASTIC "feature change", please ensure you have followed ALL instructions for creating the new "feature request".
Here is what you must do inside this "feature drop request":
  1. Choose the "feature drop request" title as usual.
  2. State and explain your REPLACEMENT plans instead of only writing about a "pure" drop.
  3. Link the "original issue" as well as your new "feature request" inside the "Related Issues" section.

Keep ALL of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
ONLY add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.

## Problem/Motivation
<!--
Describe your problem or motivation that caused your feature drop request as detailed as possible.
Why should the feature be dropped? Is it too complicated? Is it not needed? Is its functionality already covered by another feature? Is it going to be replaced by another feature?
-->
*None*

## Solution Proposal
<!--
Describe the solution that you have in mind as detailed as possible.
What needs to be removed to drop the whole feature (or its remains)? Should it be replaced by another feature, and if yes, which one?

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
