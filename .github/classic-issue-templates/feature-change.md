<!--
How to use this template:
If the feature's functionality does not change essentially:
  1. Look for the ORIGINAL ISSUE that introduced the feature you want to change and INCLUDE ITS FEATURE NAME in the issue title.
  2. Link the "original issue" inside the "Related Issues" section.
        
  For DRASTIC feature changes, consider replacing the old feature with your idea:
  DO NOT USE A "FEATURE CHANGE REQUEST".
  1. Instead, create a new "feature request" with a new, fitting title.
  2. Then, look for the ORIGINAL ISSUE that introduced the feature you want to replace.
  3. Link the "original issue" in your new "feature request" inside the "Related Issues" section.
  4. As a last step, open a "feature drop request" for the feature you want to replace.
    1. There, state and explain your replacement plans instead of only writing about a "pure" drop.
    2. Link the "original issue" as well as your new "feature request" in your new "feature drop request" inside the "Related Issues" section.

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
  Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
  If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
  You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
