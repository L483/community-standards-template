How to use this template:
This template is NOT meant for reporting vulnerabilities.
It is meant e.g. for switching from an outdated best practice, to a newer best practice, where the old best practice is not specifically vulnerable, but the newer best practice is more sophisticated and even more secure.

The issue name has to be written in kebap-case.
Keep all of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
Only add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.
-->

## Object of Interest
<!-- describe the parts that could be improved as specific as possible -->
*None*

## Problem/Motivation

*None*

## Solution Proposal
<!-- describe the solution you have in mind as detailed as possible -->
*None*

## Impact
<!-- describe potential side effects of your solution proposal that can cause follow-up issues to the best of your knowledge -->
*None*

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- specify the acceptance criteria as a task list with one or more entries: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists -->

Label usage:
- select any number of fitting labels with a "Flag: " prefix
- select any number of fitting labels with a "For: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Priority: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Scope: " prefix
- do not add, change or remove any label with a "Status: " or "Type: " prefix

Look at the label descriptions to get a better understanding of them and pick the most fitting.
If more than one "Type: " label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
The issue should then be split into multiple issues in a way that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
