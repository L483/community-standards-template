<!--
How to use this template:
If there are multiple, little text corrections, you can mention them bundled in the same issue, because the effort of writing issues should not drastically overweigh the effort of resolving them.
Make sure to present each correction distinctly from the rest and use the same order of corrections in each section when bundling multiple corrections inside one issue.
However, keep in mind that this issue should only cover text corrections.
If e.g. a typo causes a bug, a "bug report" is more fitting.

The issue name has to be written in kebap-case.
Keep all of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
Only add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- specify the acceptance criteria as a task list with one or more entries: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists -->

Label usage:
- select any number of fitting labels with a "Flag: " prefix
- select any number of fitting labels with a "For: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Priority: " prefix
- select EXACTLY ONE label with a "Scope: " prefix
- do not add, change or remove any label with a "Status: " or "Type: " prefix

Look at the label descriptions to get a better understanding of them and pick the most fitting.
If more than one "Type: " label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
The issue should then be split into multiple issues in a way that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
