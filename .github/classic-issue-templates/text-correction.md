<!--
How to use this template:
Do NOT abuse a "text correction" issue to refactor the code itself, like renaming a variable or class.
Do NOT abuse a "text correction" issue to fix a bug caused by, for example, a typo, and use a "bug report" instead.
Use it ONLY for corrections of string contents, documentation parts, code comments, and any text that will be displayed to users.
        
If there are "multiple little improvement suggestions", you can mention them bundled within a "single issue" because the effort of writing issues should not drastically surpass the effort of resolving them.
Make sure to present each improvement DISTINCTLY from the rest and to use the SAME ORDER of refinements in each section when bundling multiple improvements inside one issue.

Keep ALL of the text encapsulated in comments, even though it will not be rendered.
ONLY add text in the places that are filled with *None* default and replace *None* with your text.
-->

## Object of Interest

Describe the parts that require a text correction as specifical as possible.

## Reason

Describe why the current choice of words was bad/which other implications the text carries, or name which language rules the text violates.

<!--
Information for contributors about label usage:
        
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `Flag: ` prefix
  - select any number of fitting labels that have a `For: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Priority: ` prefix
  - select EXACTLY ONE label that has a `Scope: ` prefix
  - NEVER tamper with the initial `Status: Pending` label when creating an issue
  - NEVER add, remove, or change any associations (or the lack thereof) between an issue and label that has a `Type: ` prefix
        
Look at the label descriptions to grasp their proper usage and pick the most fitting.
If more than one `Type: ` label fits the issue, it is a good indicator that the issue mixes concerns.
You should then split this issue into multiple issues so that each new issue falls EXACTLY INTO ONE category.
